        <h2>Coloring Transitions</h2>

        <p>Eshmun provides the feature of coloring transitions according to their process. 
        This is a great visual aid and can provide helpful insights about the problem/model at hand.</p> <br/>
        		
		<p>
		Transitions are mapped to process by comparing the labels of the start and end state of the transition, if 
		labels belonging to more than one process are changed, the transition will not be colored, if no label belonging
		to a process was changed, the transition will not be colored as well. Labels that do not belong to any process 
		(shared variables) are neutral and do not affect the coloring. The default color for transitions is black.
		</p> <br/>
		
		<p>Transitions Coloring is disabled by default, to switch it on/off go to View Menu -> Color Transitions.</p> 
		<br/>
		
		<p>Transitions Coloring has 2 coloring mode: <b>Screen Mode</b> and <b>Print Mode</b>. Screen mode is optimal
		for on screen display. Print Mode is optimized to make colors clear and visible when printing using black and 
		white (or colored) printers. <b>Note that the mode is automatically set</b>, the screen mode is the default, 
		and the print mode is switched on when <b>exporting</b> the structure <b>as image</b>.</p>
		<br/>
        		
		<p>
		<b>Coloring Single Kripke Structures</b>
		<p>Coloring Single Kripke Structures makes sense for a specific type of Structures. The Structure should have 
		multiple processes making transitions, these processes need to be identified in the <b>structure name</b>.</p> <br>
		
		<p> For example, If we have a single Kripke Structure representing Mutex for 3 processes (named from A to C) a 
		suitable name would be <b>mutex (A, B, C)</b>. The process name could be a number or a string containing 
		alphanumeric characters.</p>  		
		</p> <br/>
		
		<p>
		<b>Coloring Concurrent Kripke Structures</b>
		<p>Transitions made by the same process will have the same color across all pairs. Note that the larger the 
		number of processes are, the closer the colors get to one another.</p> 
		</p>  		
		</p> <br/>
		
		<p>
		<b>Coloring Actions</b>
		<p>
		Transitions with action labels are displayed with a circle in the center, the circle will contain the action
		label. The circle can also be colored according to the action, each action will have a single fixed color across
		all pair structures, if a transition is labeled with more than one action, then multiple colors will stack around
		one another. To turn coloring for actions on/off Go to View Menu -> Color Actions.
		</p><br/>
		</p> 
		
		<p>
		<b>Customizing Colors</b>
		<p>
		The user can choose the colors to use for each process and action. Sometimes the colors are too close to tell apart
		easily. Go to View Menu -> Customize Colors. A dialog box will appear with a list of process names and action labels
		on the left. Choose a process name or action label then pick the desired color from the color palette on the right
		side. When done, click OK (or cancel to discard changes).
		</p><br/>
		</p> 
		
		<h2>Displaying Transitions by Process</h2>
		<p>If the Transition Coloring feature is enabled, one could go further and decide to show/hide specific processes.
		To do so go to View Menu -> Show/Hide Processes, a sub-menu will appear containing a list of all processes in the
		current displayed structure, you can choose which processes to show and which processes to hide.</p> <br/>
		
		<p>The Show/Hide Processes Menu could be <b>Inactive</b>, in which case, either the transitions coloring feature
		is not switched on, or the structure does not identify the processes it contains in its name. For help in identifying
		the processes in the name please go to the <b>Structure Name</b> Section in the <b>Manipulate Structure</b> page.</p> <br/>

        <h2>Logic and Syntax</h2>

        <p>
        <b>Specifications</b>
        <p>Should be written into the first Box bellow the Graph panel. Note
        that each Kripke structure inside a Concurrent Kripke would have its own 
        specifications. Please wait a few moments after typing to allow the 
        thread to process the input before switching from one Tab to the other.</p>
        </p> <br/>
        
        <p>
        <b>Structural Formula</b>
        <p>It gets added immidiadtly to the repair formula.</p>
        <p>It is unique for all currently-open structures.</p>
        <p>To insert a State or transition variable, you can select the state or transition
        and copy the variable name from the info panel (right bellow the structural formula),
        or you could click on the state / transition while holding the left shift key, if so
        the name of the variable gets inserted in the position of the caret in the structural
        formula box.</p>
        </p> <br/>
        
        <p>
        <b>IDE-like Enviroment</b>
        <p>Provides auto matching of parenthesis, move the caret next to a parenthesis and it
        will be underlined with its match.</p>
        <p>Syntax coloring, and syntax error detection (in red).</p>
        <p>The Enviroment will also add extra parenthesis in order to make the operator precedence
        clear and remove ambiguities. To override operator precedence use parenthesis.</p>
        </p> <br/>
        
        <p>
        <b>Syntax</b>
        <p>Details about the syntax:
        <ul>
	        <li>The syntax is case-sensitive.</li>
	        <li>Boolean Variable: a Boolean Variable starts with a letter, can contain letters, underscores, and numbers. <br/>
				The name cannot be one of 'A', 'E', 'U', 'W', 'V', 'AG', 'AF', 'AX', 'EG', 'EF', 'EX', 'true', 'false' as 
				those are reserved keywords. <br/>
				Shared variables can be included in the formula, shared variables can be valued variables, in which case they must be included
				with a comparison, the syntax for this is <i>&lt;variable name&gt;</i>{<i>&lt;process index&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;process index&gt;</i>, ...} = <i>&lt;value&gt;</i>
				The process indices are necessary in Concurrent Kripke Structures.  
	        </li>
	        <li>Boolean Literal: 'true' or 'false'.</li>
	        <li>CTL Operators: Split into these types: <ol>
		        <li>Unary CTL Operators: 'AG', 'AF', 'AX', 'EG', 'EF', 'EX'. <br>
			        should be written as operator(expression). For example: AG(q => p).
		        </li>
		        <li>Indexed Next Operators: 'AX', 'EX' can both be indexed by processes and/or actions,
		        	this gives the ability to quantify over next-states reached by a specific set of
		        	processes and labeled by a specific set of actions. <br>
		        	This should be written as: <i>&lt;op&gt;_{&lt;process&gt;,@&lt;action&gt;,...}(&lt;exp&gt;)</i>. 
		        	The order of names does not matter. <b>There should not be any spaces between the names</b>.		        	
		        	For example: AX_{1,@a1,@a2}(q) expresses that all transitions of process 1 out of the current
		        	state that are labeled with <b>both</b> actions a1 and a2 must lead to a state that satisfies q.
		        </li>
		        <li>Binary CTL Operators: 'AU', 'EU', 'AW', 'EW', 'AV', 'EV'. <br>
			        should be written as quantifier(expression Modality expression). For example: A(q U p).
		        </li>
	        </ol></li>
	        <li>Boolean Operator: <ol>
		        <li>Equivalence Operator: &lt;=&gt; <br>
			        Commutative and associative: P &lt;=&gt; Q &lt;=&gt; T is the same as Q &lt;=&gt; T &lt;=&gt; P. <br>
			        However, Notice that P &lt;=&gt; Q &lt;=&gt; T means (P &lt;=&gt; Q) and Q &lt;=&gt; T). <br>
			        While P &lt;=&gt; (Q &lt;=&gt; T) means P &lt;=&gt; (X) where X is the result of Q &lt;=&gt; T. 
		        </li>
		        <li>Implication Operator: =&gt;<br>
			        Implications can be chained, for example P =&gt; Q =&gt; T, is equivalent to P =&gt; (Q =&gt; T).
		        </li>
		        <li>And Operator: &<br>
			        For example: P & Q & T. and is commutative.
		        </li>
		        <li>Or Operator: |<br>
			        For example: P | Q | T. and is commutative.
		        </li>
		        <li>Not Operator: !<br>
			        For example !P, !(P & Q), ...
		        </li>
	        </ol></li>
        <li>Parenthesized Expression: Any of the above types surrounded by parenthesis.</li>
        </ul> 
        </p> <br/>

        <p>Operator Precedence: From Lowest to highest<ul>
	        <li>Equivalence: if an expression has an equivalence or more not surrounded 
		        by parenthesis then the whole expression is guaranteed to be an equivalence. <br>
		        For example: P & Q <=> !Q <=> AG(X) | AG => x is equivalent to (P & Q) <=> (!Q) <=> (AG(X) | AG => x)
	        </li>
	        <li>Implication: has the second lowest precedence after equivalence. The scope of the Implication extends
		        (left and right) until the nearest un-parenthesized equivalence. <br>
		        For example : P & Q | AG(X) => S | Q => X is equivalent to (P & Q | AG(X)) => ( (S | Q) => X )
	        </li>
	        <li>And: When having a sequence of ands and ors, each consecutive sequence of or is grouped as a term in an and. <br>
		        For example : P & Q & Z | Y | X & N & M | X & S is equivalent to (P) & (Q) & (Z | Y | X) & (N) & (M | X) & (S)
	        </li>
	        <li>Or: Cannot contain any other boolean operator except for not (unless operators were parenthesized). <br>
		        For example : P & Q | X | !Y | (X & P) is equivalent to (P) & ((Q) | (X) | (!Y) | (X & P))
	        </li>
	        <li>Not: Highest precedence among boolean operators. Tends to be atomic unless attached to a parenthesized expression. <br>
		        !X & Y => !Q & !(Q <=> K) is equivalent to ( (!(X)) & (Y) ) => ( (!(Q)) & ( !(Q <=> K) ) )
	        </li>
	        <li>CTL Operators: the scope of any CTL Operator is only within the parenthesized expression attached to it. <br>
		        AG(X => Q & AF(K)) => Q is equivalent to ( AG( (X) => ( Q & ( AF(K) )) ) ) => Q <br>
		        Inside the scope of the CTL Operator the same order of precedence is respected.
	        </li>
	        <li>Parenthesized Expression: has the highest precedence, used in the usual way.</li>
        </ul></p>

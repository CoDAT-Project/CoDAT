        <h2>Synchronization Skeletons</h2>
	
		<p>
		Eshmun supports expressing models/programs as synchronization skeletons. Synchronization skeletons are simple structure,
		each process has a set of states connected with transitions, with a special start state. Each transition has a guard, which
		is a boolean formula that express when a transition can be taken and what its effects are. The boolean formula is written in
		terms of the state of the other processes (hence the name "synchronization"), while the effect is usually an assignment to
		a shared variable. 
		</p> <br/>
		
        <p>
        <b>Model/Program Translation</b>
        <p>
        Eshmun can automatically translate a program from a Kripke Structure to a Synchronization skeleton (and vice-versa). To translate a 
        Kripke structure (concurrent or single) to a synchronization skeleton, go to Tools menu -> To Synchronization Skeleton. To translate
        a Synchronization skeleton to a Kripke Structure, go to Tools menu -> Generate Kripke Structure, a pop-up will appear asking if the
        generated structure should be single or concurrent.
        </p> <br/>
                
        <p>
        <b>Manipulating Synchronization Skeletons</b>
        <p>You can also create a synchronization skeleton from scratch. Go to File Menu -> New -> Synchronization skeleton. Saving and loading
        works as usual (check the next section for more information).</p>
        <p>The same controls mentioned in the first section apply for editing the skeleton (including Undo, redo, edit, auto-format, zoom, ...).
        Check the respective sections for more information.</p> <br/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Editing Guards</b>
        <p>Additionally, you can edit/create guards. When creating a new transition, a pop-up will show asking for the guard. To edit a transition's
        guard, select the transition and go to Edit Menu -> Edit (or alternatively right click on the transition and click Edit in the pop-up menu).
        </p> <br/>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Guard Syntax</b> 
        <ul>
        <li><b>Guards</b> are a list of <i>boolean formulae</i> with <i>effects</i> and <i>compositions</i>.</li> 
        
        <li><b>Boolean Formulae</b> follows the syntax and precedence rules mentioned under <a href="logic.html">Logic and Syntax</a> section. </li>
        
        <li><b>Effects</b> are separated from the boolean formula with an ->, and have the following syntax 
        <i>&lt;variable name&gt;</i> { <i>&lt;process index&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;process index&gt;</i>, ... } := <i>&lt;value&gt;</i>;
        Multiple effects can be combined by writing them after one another (separated by a ;). You can also use the special value bottom
        to un-set the value of a variable, bottom can be written in the editor using <b>/|\</b>. 
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Composing Guards</b> can be done by using one of the two operator: GUARD_AND or GUARD_OR. GUARD_AND indicates that
        for a transition to be taken, both guards must be evaluate to true, and both effects will occur, it is a short cut for
        writing a single guard as a conjunction of the two guards and combining the two effects. GUARD_OR indicates that for the transition
        to be taken, one of the guards must evaluate to true (at least), and guards that evaluate to true will have their effects executed.
        GUARD_AND and GUARD_OR can be written in the editor as _&_ and _|_. They will appear as a times and a plus inside a circle respectively.
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Actions in Guards</b> You can reference actions inside guards, actions must be preceded with the @ symbol. The @ symbol is not
        part of the action name; it serves only to distinguish actions from other labels/propositions. You can compose actions with other 
        actions and labels using the usual boolean and guard connectives. Actions can only appear inside the guard's formulae and not inside the 
        effects. For exmaple (@a1 & T1 -> P{1,2}:=0) indicates that this guard is synchronized by the action a1.<br/></li>

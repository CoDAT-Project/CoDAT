        <h2>Concurrent Kripke Structure</h2>

        <p>A Concurrent Kripke Structure is a model for concurrent programs, 
        it is made by a collection of Pair Kripke Structures(*).</p> <br/>
        
        <p>To create a new a Concurrent Kripke Structure go to File Menu -> New 
        -> Concurrent Kripke Structure (Ctrl + m in Short).</p> <br/>
        
        <p>This will change main panel into a tabbed panel, the title of each 
        tab is the name of the contained sub Kripke Structure and the process-pair
        inside that structure.</p> <br/>
        
        <p>
        <b>Managing Structures:</b>
        You can do the following: <ul>
            <li>Add a new structure: right click on any tab title -> Add. A
            Dialog will appear asking for the name of the new structure (has 
            to be unique), and the process pair inside the structure (also 
            unique).</li>
            <li>Edit a structure: right click on the its title -> Edit. A 
            Dialog will appear asking for the new name and the process pair, same
            constraint apply.</li>
            <li>Remove a structure: right click on its title -> Remove.</li>
            <li>Process Indices: The indices can be any string excluding white
            spaces, commas, equals, and curly braces. The labels of states that reflect a process
            related functionality must be suffixed with the appropriate
            index.</li>
        </ul>
        </p> <br/>
        
        <p>
        <b>Shared Variables:</b>
        Any label that is not suffixed with any process index is a shared variable. Shared variables
        are scoped according to their Pair Kripke Structure. That is, shared variable x in the pair
        structure of processes 1 and 2, is different from x in the pair structure of processes 2 and 3. <br/>
        Shared Variables can have values (integers or strings), in which case the symbol := is used for 
        assigning the value. The = symbol without the preceding : is used in formulae to represent a test
        of the value. It can not be used inside the state label definition.
        </p> <br/>
        
        <p>
        <b>Process Indices and Actions Synchronization:</b>
        In a concurrent structure, synchronization across pairs can be done in two ways: <ul>
        <li>Eshmun can automatically synchronize a process transitions across all pairs, Eshmun
        will deduce which transition to synchronize based on the changes a transition inflicts on
        the state of its process. For this to work, The structure must be a valid pair structure(*).</li>
        <li>A user can manually label transitions with action names, each transition can have more than one
        action name, synchronization of these actions ensures that either all of the transition label by one
        action are removed, or at least one is retained per pair.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Users can control which of these synchronizations are used and which are ignored. Go to the Edit
        Menu -> Sync Actions, Edit Menu -> Sync Process Indices to turn the synchronization on/off.</p>
        
        <p>To change the action label of a transition, click on the transition and then go to Edit Menu
        -> Edit (or right click on the transition and choose Edit Action). Then a dialog will appear
        where action labels can be inserted (comma-separated).</p>
        </p> <br/>
	    
	    <p>
	    <b>Manipulating a sub-structure:</b>
	    You can Manipulate each structure in the same manner as the single kripke structure. 
	    Clear, Undo, and Redo only affect the current open sub structure.
	    </p> <br/>
	    
	    <p>
	    <b>Auto generating Isomorphic pairs:</b>
	    You can auto generate Isomorphic pairs from any <u>single</u> Kripke structure. Open the desired single Kripke
	    structure, click on the Edit -> Generate Pairs, then enter the specific number of pairs, you will then be
	    prompted for the arrangement of the pairs: <ul>	    
	    <li>You can choose to generate all pairs, in which case the generated pairs will contain all distinct combination 
	    of 2 processes between process 1 to n. n being the number of pairs entered. This is used for Mutex.</li>
	    <li>You can also choose to generate pairs on a ring, in which case the generated pairs will be pairs of consecutive
	    pairs (neighbors), such that the last pair contains the first and last process. This is used for Dining Philosophers.</li>
	    </ul>
	    </p> <br/>
	    
	    <p>
	    <b>(*) Pair Kripke Structure:</b>
	    For a single Kripke structure to be a valid <u>Pair</u> structure, it must contain two processes only,
	    each transition can make a move on one of the two processes (not both), labels ending with a process index (
	    could be an integer or a string) are considered to be process specific, labels not ending with such an index
	    are considered to be shared variables.

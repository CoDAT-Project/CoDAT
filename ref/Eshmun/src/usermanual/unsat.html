        <h2>Unsat Core</h2>

        <p>
        Eshmun has the option to use a Minimal Unsat Core Extractor, in particular <a href="http://logos.ucd.ie/web/doku.php?id=muser">MUSer2</a>. 
        </p> <br/>
        
        <p>
        Eshmun will use the minimal unsat core, to pick a small subset of states/transitions that is making a model un-repairable against some 
        specifications. This small subset captures the conflicts Eshmun is facing when attempting to repair the model. It is worth noting that
        this subset is not the actual minimum in terms of states/transitions, since MUSer2 works on the repair formula which contains extra internal
        variables.
        </p> <br/>
        
        <p>
        The Minimal Unsat Core feature can provide users with important semantic feedback, and allow them to intervene in how the repair is 
        conducted, and get insight as to which parts of the model requires modification for the repair to become valid.
        </p> <br/>
        
        <p>To use the feature, you will MUSer2 as working binaries, which you can download from <a href="http://logos.ucd.ie/web/doku.php?id=muser">
        here</a> (http://logos.ucd.ie/web/doku.php?id=muser).</p> <br/>
        
        <p>By default, Eshmun will look for MUSer2 in a directory named "MUS". The MUS directory must be placed immediately next to Eshmun for
        auto detection, make sure the "MUS" directory contains the binaries immediately (especially 'run-muser2'), and that they are not nested
        inside it. Also, make sure you have read, write, and execute permissions to that directory and binaries.</p> <br/>
        
        <p>If MUSer2 was not found in the default location, Eshmun will prompt to manually enter the location. Make sure to browse to the
        directory containing the binaries directly. The new location will be saved for this session, and Eshmun will not ask for it again 
        until you exist.</p> <br/>

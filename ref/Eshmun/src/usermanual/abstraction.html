        <h2>Abstractions</h2>

        <p>
        <b>Abstraction By Label</b>
        <p>This abstraction groups states together by the labels they satisfy, only the labels
        within the specifications are used within this abstraction. This abstraction works best
        for specifications that contain permutations of a small number of labels. <br/>
        To Abstract by label, go to Tools -> Abstract By Label.</p>
        </p> <br/>
        
        <p>
        <b>Abstraction By Sub Formula</b>
        <p>This abstraction uses the largest (in size) sub formulae in the specifications that 
        do not contain CTL. The states are grouped based on the truth values of all these sub
        formulae, this abstraction reduces the state space heavily. It works best for
        large specifications that contain many labels but few CTL modalities. <br/>
        To Abstract by Sub Formula, go to Tools -> Abstract By Formula.</p>
        </p> <br/>
        
        <p>
        <b>Repairing By Abstraction:</b>
        <p>To repair by using abstraction, first you must carry out the desired abstraction, then
        repair the resulting new structure, if repair was successfully, you can project it back to
        the original structure using Tools -> Concretize Repair. </p> <br>
        
        <p>Concretizing a repair involves model checking the new structure, in case the model check 
        fail, the abstracted structure will be made visible again, with an error message. You
        can either retain states/transitions or traverse to another repair, then try to concretize
        again.</p> <br>
        
        <p>If concretizing succeeds, the original structure will be displayed, with the concretized 
        repair dashed. If you wish to go back the original structure disregarding the abstraction
        you can go to Tools -> Cancel Abstraction. </p> <br>
        </p> <br/>
        
        <p>
        The abstraction is extended to concurrent structures, concurrent abstraction will abstract every pair against
        its specifications. Repairing and Concretizing follows the description above, however, when concretizing, the
        structure is checked for synchronization between the different pairs in addition to model checking it
        against the specifications.

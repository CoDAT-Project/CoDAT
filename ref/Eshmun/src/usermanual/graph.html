        <h2>Graph Manipulating: Single Kripke Structure</h2>

        <p>By default, Eshmun loads in Single Kripke Structure mode.</p>
	    
	    <p>You can create a new Kripke Structure, by going to the File menu
	    -> New -> Kripke Structure (Ctrl + k).</p>
	    <p> <br/>
	    <b>States:</b>
        You can add a new states by any one of these ways:<ul>
            <li>Insert Menu -> State</li>
            <li>Right Click on a Free Spot -> New State</li>
            <li>Press Insert button with focus inside the Graph Panel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A dialog will appear, you need to provide a unique name for the state, as well 
        as the propositional labels it satisfies (comma separated).</p>
	    </p> <br/>
	    	    
	    <p>
	    <b>Transitions:</b>
        You can add a new transition by any one of these ways:<ul>
            <li>With a State selected, Go to Insert Menu -> Transition</li>
            <li>Right Click on a State -> Add Transition</li>
            <li>With a State selected, Press Shift + insert.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The state selected before attempting to add a transition would be the start state, after attempting the add the next
        state selected would be the end state of the new transition.</p>        
	    </p> <br/>
	    
	    <p>
	    <b>Editing & Removing</b>
	    <p>To Edit and remove a state or a transition, select it, then either go to the Edit menu, or right click on it.</p>
	    <p>Also, You can edit a state by simply double clicking on it, or selecting it then pressing F2. You could also delete
	    a state or a transition by selecting it then pressing delete.</p>
	    </p> <br/>
	    
	    <p>
	    <b>Structure Name</b>
	    <p>You are advised to give your structures meaningful names, this will help later in case you decided to use
	    the structure in a Concurrent Kripke Structure. If the structure contains different processes it is advised to 
	    state these processes in the structure name (comma separated inside parenthesis). For example: mutex(A, B, C).</p> <br/>

		<p>To change the structure name, go to the Edit Menu -> Edit Structure Name or press F4. You will be prompted to enter
		the structure name. Note that for Concurrent Kripke Structure, the procedure for changing the name and the constraints 
		on the names are different.</p>	    
	    </p> <br/>
	    
	    <p>
	    <b>Shared Variables</b>
	    <p>You can defined shared variables (that take values) inside the structure, the shared variable is part of the state and
	    is written among its propositional labels. </p>
	    <p>The syntax for shared variables is <i>&lt;variable name&gt;</i>{<i>&lt;process index&gt;</i>,<i>&lt;process index&gt;</i>,...}:=<i>&lt;value&gt;</i>
	    If process indices are omitted, then the shared variable is considered shared between all the process in the current structure. </p>
	    </p> <br/>
	    
	    <p>
	    <b>Formatting and Spacing</b>
	    <p>You can drag and drop states to change your positions, simply hold the left mouse button while on a state to start moving it.</p>
	    <p>You might want to auto space and format the graph, to do so, go to View menu -> Auto format. If the resulting Graph is not pleasing
	    enough, you could alter few states manually, then attempt to auto format it again.</p>
	    <p>Please notice the larger the structure the greater the time needed to format it.</p>
	    </p> <br/>
	    
	    <p>
	    <b>Clear, Undo, & Redo</b>
	    <p>You can clear the current structure by pressing right click on any free point, 
	    then choosing clear (Ctrl + l).</p>
	    <p>You can undo/redo any changes to the current structure by going to the Edit menu ->
	    Undo / Redo (Ctrl + z, Ctrl + y respectively).

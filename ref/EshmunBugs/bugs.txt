1. PetersonAbstractionExample/

File PetBool.txt contains correct code for Petersons two process mutual exclusion algorithm

File PetBoolClusteredAbstraction.kpk contains a Kripke structure that shows the clustering according to the abstraction which
uses as abstraction formulae N1, T1, C1, N2, T2, C2.
Most states are alone, but the are several pairs of states that the abstraction algorithm considers equivalent, but they should not be considered equivalent. so it seems to be a bug in the abstraction algorithm


2. Voting/

File AVOS.mkp: contains the Kripke structure for a voting machine

File AVOSprog.txt contains the extracted program. Upon importing this program, one obtains a
  completely different Kripke structure than AVOS.mkp, which leads me to think that the extraction algorithm is incorrect.
  This is born out by manual inspection of AVOS-Prog.txt

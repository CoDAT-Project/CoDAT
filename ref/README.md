The latest version of Eshmun can be found at *Eshmun/Eshmun.jar*. If you want to modify the code and build it you will need [ANTLR][antlr] >= 4.6. If you plan to use Eclipse, the following [plugin for ANTLR][antlride] may help.

### Javadoc
The javadoc is available in */documentation*. Open */documentation/index.html* in your browser to get started.
Make sure to write proper javadoc in your code so that documentation for your code may be later added to the javadoc.

### User manual
A detailed user manual on how to use Eshmun is available inside Eshmun. Open Eshmun and you will find it under the help menu (or use F1 as a shortcut).
The usermanual contains details on how to use Eshmun to create and edit structures and describe the specifications with CTL.
It explains how to use the different features of Eshmun (model checking, repair, abstractions, ...). It provides general tips about modeling and effectively using Eshmun.

The source of the user manual is in HTML, and can be found under */Eshmun/src/usermanual*. You are encouraged to add explanations to the user manual for any feature you add.

### Bug reports, help, and other kinds of support.
Feel free to use the github issues features to report bugs or ask for clarifications about any aspect of the code. 
Use the proper classification for your issues that reflect how severe the bug is and how urgently it should be fixed.

### Merging with master
If you are finished with your modifications, and have sufficient confidence in its correctness, open a pull request between your branch and the 
master branch. You are encouraged to provide some test cases to demonstrate the modifications. Your changes may be sligthely edited before merging.

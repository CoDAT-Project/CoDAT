# Specification

## General Description

The Python Assert Tester, or PAT, is a tool designed to be used as an interface between the user and a backend computational engine. The PAT will determine if an individual or series of asserts will succeed or fail given a input function written in Python. Depending on the complexity of the input, the PAT may use an SMT solver to aid in the computation.

## Product Scope

The PAT will accomplish the following objectives:

1. Provide the user with feedback on if an assert fails given a particular input script and assert value.
2. If the assert fails, provide the user feedback on specifics of what cause the assertion to fail.
3. If possible, provide remediation suggestions for the user to implement to fix assertion failure.

## Product Value

This product would be useful in helping software developers develop reliable code through assertion checking. 

## Intended Audience

The intended auidence for this program would be software developers and engineers.

## Intended Use

The intended use is as a SMT interface and general assert tester.
